### WHY GET VACCINATED?

- Vaccination is the most important measure to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic.  

- It helps protect people from getting sick or severely ill with COVID-19 and also limits the spread of this disease to close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers.  

- *All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in India have been shown to be safe and effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine helps keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.*   
- NOTE: One should receive all recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
