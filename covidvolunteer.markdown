Note: These are mainly college students from various places, working as volunteers to help the people in need of COVID related issues during these trying times. THEY ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SITE AND TEAM. We have incorporated these contacts so that you may find them useful if you need someone in your area to help.
